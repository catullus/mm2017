## Function: calculate and munge weekly ranks -- pass function to ddply

* Villanova is in top 5 for entire country (they won 2016 tourney)
* #1 ranked Kansas made it to Final Four, lost to Villanova
* Miami FL is in top 15, and made it to Elite Eight
* Maryland is in top 30, and made it to Elite Eight
* Oregon is in top 3, and made it to Final Four
* Oklahoma is in top 15 and made it to Final Four
* Texas A&M made it to Elite Eight and is in top 20
* Duke is in top 30, made it to Elite Eight
* Syracuse only potential 'Dark Horse', made it to Final Four but was not Ranked Top 30 for 2016 season

## Munge: Calculate ranks throughout season

```{r}
reg$wdiff <- reg$Wscore - reg$Lscore
reg$ldiff <- reg$Lscore - reg$Wscore


#start <- Sys.time()
regrank <-  plyr::ddply(reg, .(Season), function(x) {ranker(x)})
#end <- Sys.time()
#end-start

```

## Explore: Winning_Team_Rank / Losing_Team_Rank ~ Score Differential per game

* Do games with equal ranked teams result in smaller differences?
  * For the most part, higher ranked teams win much more
* How many lower ranked teams beat higher ranked teams?
  * Teams to the left of the vertical red line = lower ranked teams beating higher ranked teams
  * Win differences seem to be smaller for lower ranked teams beating higher

```{r}
ggplot(regrank, aes(Wteam_rank/Lteam_rank, wdiff)) + geom_point() + geom_vline(xintercept = 1, colour = "red")
```

## Calculate: Weight Wins and Losses via the Wteam_rank and Lteam_rank

```{r}
## WEIGHT ALG
head(regrank)
regrank$win_weight <- (regrank$Lteam_rank/regrank$Wteam_rank)*1
regrank$loss_weight <- (regrank$Lteam_rank/regrank$Wteam_rank)*1

ggplot(regrank, aes(win_weight, wdiff)) + geom_point()

## fix this
m_rf_weekly_ranks <- randomForest()
```

## Munge: Process Regular Season data e.g. 'Stack' the win and loss data frames to quickly count end of season statistics (e.g. wins and losses)

```{r}
wreg <- select(regrank, Season, Daynum, Wteam, Wscore, Wteam_rank, Wloc, Numot, wdiff, win_weight, Week) %>% rename(team=Wteam,score=Wscore,loc=Wloc,diff=wdiff, weight=win_weight, rank=Wteam_rank)
lreg <- select(regrank, Season, Daynum, Lteam, Lscore, Lteam_rank, Wloc, Numot, ldiff, loss_weight, Week) %>% rename(team=Lteam,score=Lscore,loc=Wloc,diff=ldiff, weight=loss_weight, rank=Lteam_rank)
outreg <- rbind(wreg,lreg)

## count wins and losses
outreg$outcome <- ifelse(outreg$diff > 0, "win", "loss")

proc_reg <- group_by(outreg, Season, team) %>%
  arrange(Week) %>% 
  dplyr::summarise(totwin=sum(str_count(outcome, "win")),
                   totloss=sum(str_count(outcome, "loss")),
                   totwin_weight=sum(ifelse(diff>0, as.numeric(weight), 0)),
                   totloss_weight=sum(ifelse(diff<0, as.numeric(weight), 0)),
                   final_rank=tail(rank, 1),
                   rank_sd=sd(rank),
                   wdiff_avg=mean(ifelse(diff>0, as.numeric(diff), 0)),
                   ldiff_avg=mean(ifelse(diff<0, as.numeric(diff), 0)),
                   score_avg=mean(score),
                   score_sd=sd(score),
                   wdiff_sd=sd(ifelse(diff>0, as.numeric(diff),0)),
                   ldiff_sd=sd(ifelse(diff<0, as.numeric(diff),0))

                   ldiff_sd=sd(ifelse(diff<0, as.numeric(diff),0))
                   )

## rename "T_" == tournament data
names(proc_tourn) <- paste0("T_",names(proc_tourn))
```


## Execute a merge so we can model tourney_outcomes ~ reg_season_data

```{r}
## make keys to match the data between the two tables
proc_reg$key <- paste0(proc_reg$Season,"_",proc_reg$team)
proc_tourn$key <- paste0(proc_tourn$T_Season,"_",proc_tourn$T_team)

## the tournament results should be the left table, because the proc_reg table 
## has results of ALL teams that played (i.e. even teams that didn't make it to the tourney)
model_dat <- merge(proc_tourn, proc_reg, by.x="key", by.y="key")
model_dat <- merge(model_dat, season_end_wins)

model_dat$win_pct <- model_dat$totwin / (model_dat$totwin + model_dat$totloss)
model_dat$win_pct_weighted <- model_dat$totwin_weight / (model_dat$totwin_weight + model_dat$totloss_weight)
```

## EDA via Scatterplot Matrix

```{r}
car::scatterplotMatrix(~T_totwin+final_rank+rank_sd+win_pct+win_pct_weighted+score_avg+score_sd+wdiff_sd+last6_win, data = model_dat)
```

## FUNCTION: map pre-tourney results against actual tourney outcomes

* i.e. can regular season stats become a binary predictor for tourney matchups? If so, which ones are the best? Best = >50% predictions correct
* Assess binary outcomes e.g. does Wteam_rank > Lteam_rank = a win?
* Does Wteam_3point_avg > Lteam_3point_avg
* Predictors: 
  * Seed
  * Rank
  * Win_pct
  * Win_pct_weighted
